![EyeBench Overview](./docs/figures/eyebench_overview.png)
*Figure 1: Overview of EyeBench v1.0. The benchmark curates multiple datasets for predicting reader properties (👩), and reader–text interactions (👩+📝) from eye movements. ⭐ marks prediction tasks newly introduced in EyeBench. The data are preprocessed and standardized into aligned text and gaze sequences, which are then used as input to models trained to predict task-specific targets. The models are systematically evaluated under three generalization regimes — unseen readers, unseen texts, or both. The benchmark supports the evaluation and addition of new models, datasets, and tasks.*

## 🧠 Introduction

**EyeBench** is the first benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning models that decode cognitive and linguistic information from eye movements during reading.  
It provides a standardized, extensible framework for **predictive modeling from eye tracking data**, aiming to bridge **cognitive science and multimodal AI**.

EyeBench curates multiple publicly available datasets and tasks, covering both **reader properties** and **reader–text interactions**, and includes **baselines**, **state-of-the-art models**, and **evaluation protocols** that ensure reproducibility and comparability across studies.

Progress on EyeBench is expected to advance both **scientific understanding of human language processing** and **practical applications** such as adaptive educational systems and cognitive-aware user interfaces.

## 📚 Tasks and Datasets

EyeBench v1.0 includes **seven prediction tasks** spanning **six harmonized datasets**.  
Each task is formulated as a **single-trial prediction problem** from a reader’s eye movements while reading a passage (and optionally an auxiliary text, such as a question or claim).

### Reader Properties (👤)

| Task | Dataset | Type | Target |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| **Reading Comprehension Skill** | CopCo | Regression | Continuous comprehension score (1–10) |
| **Vocabulary Knowledge** | MECO L2 | Regression | LexTALE vocabulary test score (0–100) |
| **Dyslexia Detection** | CopCo | Classification | Clinically diagnosed dyslexia (yes/no) |

### Reader–Text Interactions (👤 + 📖)

| Task | Dataset(s) | Type | Target |
|------|-------------|------|--------|
| **Reading Comprehension** | OneStop, SB-SAT, PoTeC | Classification | Correct answer to a comprehension question |
| **Subjective Text Difficulty** | SB-SAT | Regression | Perceived difficulty rating (Likert) |
| **Domain Expertise** | PoTeC | Classification | High vs low domain expertise |
| **Claim Verification** | IITB-HGC | Classification | Correct claim verification judgment |

### Datasets Overview

| Dataset | Language | Group | #Participants | #Words | #Fixations | Tasks |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------------|----------|-------------|--------|
| OneStop (Ordinary Reading) | English | L1 | 180 | 19 427 | 1.1 M | Reading Comprehension |
| SB-SAT | English | L1/L2 | 95 | 2 622 | 263 k | Reading Comprehension, Subjective Text Difficulty |
| PoTeC | German | L1 | 75 | 1 895 | 404 k | Reading Comprehension, Domain Expertise |
| MECO L2 | English | L2 | 1 098 | 1 646 | 2.4 M | Vocabulary Knowledge |
| CopCo | Danish | L1/L2/L1-Dyslexia | 57 | 32 140 | 398 k | Reading Comprehension Skill, Dyslexia Detection |
| IITB-HGC | English | L1/L2 | 5 | 53 528 | 164 k | Claim Verification |

## 🧩 Implemented Models and Baselines

EyeBench provides **12 implemented models** and **6 baselines**, unified under a shared training and evaluation framework.

### Neural Models

- **AhnCNN** – CNN over fixation sequences (coordinates, durations, pupil size)  
- **AhnRNN** – RNN variant of AhnCNN  
- **BEyeLSTM** – LSTM combining sequential fixations and global gaze statistics  
- **PLM-AS** – LSTM processing fixation-ordered word embeddings  
- **PLM-AS-RM** – RNN integrating fixation-ordered embeddings with reading measures  
- **RoBERTEye-W** – Transformer integrating word embeddings and word-level gaze features  
- **RoBERTEye-F** – Fixation-level variant of RoBERTEye-W  
- **MAG-Eye** – Multimodal Adaptation Gate injecting gaze into transformer layers  
- **PostFusion-Eye** – Cross-attention fusion of RoBERTa embeddings and CNN fixation features  

### Traditional ML Models

- **Logistic / Linear Regression**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM / SVR)**  
- **Random Forest (Classifier / Regressor)**  

### Baselines

- **Random** and **Majority Class** (classification)  
- **Mean** and **Median** (regression)  
- **Reading Speed**  
- **Text-Only RoBERTa** (no gaze input)

## 🧮 Evaluation Protocol

EyeBench evaluates models under **three complementary generalization regimes**:

| Regime | Description | Typical Use Case |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Unseen Reader** | Texts seen, readers unseen | New readers, known materials |
| **Unseen Text** | Readers seen, texts unseen | Personalized reading of new content |
| **Unseen Reader & Text** | Both unseen | Fully general setting |

### Metrics

- **Classification:** AUROC, Balanced Accuracy  
- **Regression:** RMSE, MAE, R²  
- **Aggregate:** Average Normalized Score and Mean Rank across all task–dataset pairs.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EyeBench/eyebench.git
cd eyebench
mamba env create -f environment.yml
conda activate eyebench
```

### 2. Download and Preprocess Data

```bash
bash src/data/preprocessing/get_data.sh
```

This script downloads, harmonizes, and creates standardized folds for all datasets under `data/processed/`.

### 3. Log into Weights & Biases (WandB)

```bash
wandb login
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Train a Model

```bash
python src/run/single_run/train.py +trainer=TrainerDL +model=RoBERTEyeW +data=OneStop_RC
```

### Run a Hyperparameter Sweep

```bash
bash src/run/multi_run/sweep_wrapper.sh --data_tasks CopCo_TYP --folds 0,1,2,3 --cuda 0,1
```

### Test a Model

```bash
python src/run/single_run/test_dl.py +model=RoBERTEyeW +data=OneStop_RC
```

Results are stored under:
`
results/raw/{data_model_trainer_task}/fold_index={i}/trial_level_test_results.csv
results/eyebench_benchmark_results/{metric}.csv
`

## 🧠 Adding a New Model

1. Create a file under `src/models/YourModel.py` inheriting from `BaseModel`.
   Implement `forward()` and `shared_step()` methods.
2. Register it in:

    - `src/configs/enums.py` → `ModelNames`
    - `src/configs/model_args.py` → model config class
    - `src/configs/config.py` → `ModelMapping`

3. Define its default parameters and search space in `src/run/multi_run/search_spaces.py`.
4. Verify integration:

```bash
bash src/run/multi_run/model_checker.sh
```

---

## 📊 Adding a New Dataset

1. Store raw or preprocessed data in `data/YOUR_DATASET/`.
2. Define its loading logic in `src/data/datasets/YOUR_DATASET.py` (inherits from `ETDataset`).
3. Add preprocessing logic under `src/data/preprocessing/dataset_preprocessing/YOUR_DATASET.py`.
4. Register the dataset in `src/configs/data.py` and `src/configs/constants.py`.
5. Add a corresponding task configuration class if it supports multiple tasks.

Datasets must comply with EyeBench’s selection criteria:

- Passage-level texts
- ≥ 500 Hz sampling rate
- Publicly available raw or fixation-level data
- Released texts and gaze–text alignment
